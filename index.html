         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that have<br>
          honed my skills and deepened my appreciation for the art of software development.<br>
          I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology and collaborating with<br>
          like-minded professionals to create meaningful solutions.<br><br></p>
          <p>I bring experience and knowledge in Javascript, Python, C#, and Java. Most recently<br>
             Iâ€™ve gained skills in Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Django, and AWS.<br><br></p>  
          <p>I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from Brock University in Canada and<br>
             regularly contribute to open-source projects, particularly in the area of web<br>
             development. Outside of work, I like to play basketball and jog in the Bay Area where<br>
             I live with my husband and 5 year old son.
