         <h2>Lily Zhao</h2>
         <p>A Full-stack Software Engineer. <br></p>
         <p>As a seasoned software engineer with 5 years of experience and a background in computer<br>
          science, I am driven by a relentless passion for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. </p>
         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that have honed<br>
           my skills and deepened my appreciation for the art of software development. I'm passionate<br>
           about pushing the boundaries of technology and collaborating with like-minded professionals<br>
           to create meaningful solutions.<br><br></p>
          <p>I bring experience and knowledge in Javascript, Python, C#, and Java. Most recently Iâ€™ve<br>
             gained skills in Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Django, and AWS.<br><br></p>  
          <p>I hold a master's degree in Computer Science from Brock University in Canada and regularly<br>
             contribute to open-source projects, particularly in the area of web development. Outside of<br>
             work, I like to play basketball and jog in the Bay Area where I live with my husband and 5<br>
             years old son.
